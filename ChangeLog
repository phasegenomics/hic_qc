CHANGES
=======

* Change conda install instructions to use env.yml
* Build from env.yml file
* Undo 3.4 and 3.7 additions because travis broke on them
* Add python 3.4 and 3.7 build tests, remove setup.sh from Readme and repo
* Added pbr output files
* Add pbr dependency
* Switched to pbr for versioning
* Initial commit for functional pbr versioning
* Added .gitignore
* Testing pbr
* Switch to bam name in dup saturation plot
* Removed git merge info from file
* Merging from master
* Added stats for high quality read pairs and made numerous aesthetic improvements
* Class-based refactor (#15)
* Added additional documentation, added outfile\_prefix to paths dict, changed histogram plotting routine to remove warning
* Added additional documentation
* Pulled Assembly stats into separate table, fixed some whitespace, switched fraction/proportion references to percentages
* Set extrapolated dup rate to -1 if it fails, catch ZeroDivisionError, change fraction/proportion references to percentages
* Incorporated changes from pretty\_report\_numbers branch including updates to report template md and css files
* This is a class-based refactoring of bam\_to\_mate\_hist. It includes a number of additional features including:   - Detection of coordinate-sorted bam files (if labeled in header)   - Skipping of supplementary and secondary reads   - Counting of unmapped reads
* Add Travis CI integration (#13)
* Switch badge to be based off of master branch
* Add Travis CI badge
* Added missing scipy dependency
* Fixing travis file (again)
* Fixing travis file
* Initial commit for setup.py
* Initial commit for Travis CI
* Minor indentation fix
* Fixed issue with zero dist reads in log log plot
* Added log-log plot, use basename for bamfile in histograms
* Add default returns for V and K when exiting dupe saturation early
* Add writing out of dists file, containing all distances in the histogram
* Added V and K from dup saturation curve fitting to output tsv
* Skip unneeded metadata
* Fix leftover template call
* Replace explicit dictionary printing
* Updated README to reflect python3 support and suggest installation using conda
* Added python 3 compatibility
* updated requirements to give proper pysam version
* Fixed documentation for make\_histograms
* Fixed parse\_bam\_file doc line
* Added line for Fraction of read pairs >10KB apart mapping to contigs >10Kbp
* Added stats for proportion of reads mapping to contigs >10Kbp with >10Kbp insert size. Also added -1 option to parse all reads in bam file
* Added test cases for num 10Kbp reads, num reads mapping to 10Kbp contigs
* Updated tests to account for change to count dict, updated documentation in bam\_to\_mate\_hist.py
* Switched from list to dict for isize to reduce memory usage
* fixed a few bugs and edge cases arising from duplicate saturation curve estimation for the report. changed how reports are versioned as it was messing up HTML conversion. fixed some test cases
* Additional merge. Added extra dup stats to tsv
* Additional merge
* Merged changes from duplicate plotting branch
* fixing some stuff raised in review
* Added duplication curve plotting
* Added duplicate saturation curve plotting
* added a pass/fail row to the table, along with logic to populate it based on stats
* updates to readme to explain changes. added setup script to enable report version tracking. updates to report template to allow version tracking
* some docstring changes
* missed committing the testing changes, here they are
* added mapq zero counts, fixed tests so they don't fail with refactoring changes, fixed md template to give all data
* fixed pairs vs reads correction
* adding some features requested to report, specifically assembly stats. along the way refactoring code to avoid extremely cumbersome methods
* added \_\_init\_\_ file
* added unit tests, collateral for tests, and fixed a couple of bugs emerging in testing
* removed recommended read numbers as potentially confusing, fixed split read counting
* fixed a histogram+num reads counting bug
* fixed zero-distance counting issue
* added support for num reads desired total, basic
* last context manager add
* response to code review
* adding a little more information about duplicates in reporting
* Added some info to template boilerplate. Also fixed duplicate counting bug in script
* fixed the sam flag check for dupes (i think)
* added duplicate read support. also added code to compute assembly n50s, but not currently used
* cleaned up script a bit, packaged all of the stats handling and printing into a function to de-clutter \_\_main\_\_
* update readme for qc reports
* fixed plot path for embedding in report, a couple of minor report things
* fixed CLI for making reports option
* report now working, not beautiful. messed around with style etc. a lot
* report now working, not beautiful. messed around with style etc. a lotwq
* trying out making a pdf report. not quite working yet, had to take on a bunch of dependencies like wkhtmltopdf which i don't love, need to figure them out
* added a few additional details to readme
