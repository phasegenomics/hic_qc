<h2>Alignment distance statistics and plots</h2>
<p>We briefly describe some of the statistics we compute below to aid interpretation of this report.</p>
<h3>Fraction of read pairs &gt; 10KB apart</h3>
<h3>Fraction of read pairs mapping to different contigs or chromosomes</h3>
<h3>Fraction of zero-distance pairs</h3>
<h2>Split reads</h2>
<p>Traditionally, split reads have been a favored measure of Hi-C library quality. This is because traditional Hi-C library preparations are expected to produce many reads reading through junctions. </p>
<p>Phase Genomics libraries, whether produced in our laboratory or by means of ProxiMeta &copy;, Animal, Plant, or Human kits, will have a generally lower fraction of split reads. This is because we have optimized our Hi-C protocol to </p>
